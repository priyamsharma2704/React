1. create the prop interface/type
2. create a card type/interface
3. define a state i.e. cards using the hook and initialize it using the callback function. In that state, duplicate the given images aray, then shuffle the duplicated images. Then return a new array using shuffled images that will have items of tpe Card.
4. define handleClick() : in clicking the images, check if it is already flipped or is match. If yes then return. If not then update state by calling a callback function and update isFlipped state of that particular image that was clicked by creating a new array using the prevCard. Then filter the newArray by checking whether the card is flipped and is not matched. And then if the length of the filteredArray is= 2, then call handleMatchCard and pass filteredCard 1 and 2.
5. In the HandleMatchCard, check if card1.url == card2.url and store it in a var. And then call a setTimeout with a callback function which will have a setState with a callback function where er need to create a copy array of the original array and then we need to check the match var. if it is true, the update the card1 and card 2's isMatch to true. And if it is false, then update their isFlipped to false. And then return the newArray
